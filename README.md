# Portfolio Site

This is Sam's Portfolio Site, intended to show off my skills as a programmer.

There are 3 main views to the site -

* Home
  * The landing page with short, eye catching, and descriptive attributes of myself
* Projects
  * A page with a list of projects I've made with short descriptions and a link to their repositories
* Work History page
  * As the name states, a page with my work histroy
* Contact
  * A page consisting of imformation regarding how to contact me, as well as some links to my github and social media accounts


In creating this site, I would like to learn and showcase Angular animations along with a consistent, appealing, and easy to use design scheme.

# Ideas to expand upon

I would like this website to be a comprehensive showcase of my compentancy/expertise in development. To do so, the site should be updated and expanded upon to showcase my full skillset

Some ideas for future development include -

* Skills page
* ECMAScript Arcade
  * A page consisting of various small games created in ES
    * Simon, Speed-Math, etc...
  * These games could possibly maintain a leaderboard of scores achieved in the game
* Useful ES Tools
  * Pay calculator with state and federal tax
  * Pomodoro Timer
