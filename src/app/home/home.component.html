  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p> My name is Alan Osamu Sato, but many people call me Sam.</p>
  <p>
    I am a software developer with practical experience developing and deploying full-stack applications. I have
    created dynamic web sites utilizing popular front-end technologies such as Angular and Bootstrap, designed and
    implemented databases with Oracle SQL, and developed server side application logic with Java and the Spring
    framework. Through all of this, I have embraced the Agile project design methodology with project sprints and daily
    standups.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've created this site in order to show off some of these skills, as well as any side projects that I've worked on.
